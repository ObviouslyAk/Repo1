One of the WPAN networks, 1994.
802.15.1
10 meters mac radius of coverage.
Uses the ISM or license-free band (2.4 till 2.48 GHz for radio frequencies).
Cheap, flexible, low power.
Nominal throughput = 1 Mbps.
Hopps among 79 frequencies.
Piconet = master + (1 to 7) active slaves.
A 48 bit identifier per device (BD_ADDR).
Max tested devices connected to piconet = 255.
Frequency hopping sequence reduces interference between piconets.
Two links: SCO(slot reservation) and ACL(polling).
A piconet handles up to 3 SCO links.
Bluetooth packet types: 1, 3, and 5 slot packets.
Each slot is 625 microseconds with 1 Mbpsrate = 625 bits can be transmitted per slot.
Change from transmit to receive state = 259 microseconds.

HVx -> for SCO (voice).
DMx -> for ACL (Data with error correction or FEC).
DHx -> for ACL (Data witout FEC).
Note: (where x = 1,3,5)

2-3 users -> 5 time slots
4-6 users -> 3 time slots
7-8 users -> 1 time slot

Connection setup: Inquiry -> page -> connected!
Device in inquiry scan state responds to inquiries from devices in inquiry state.
Device in page scan state responds to connection requests from devices in page state.
Devices with no UI -> no authetication.
Devices with UI -> 6 digits code.

Scatternet bridges are active for one piconet at a time, and needs to synchronize with the FHS of the piconet.
A bridge connects only 2 piconets.

Coordinator election: Votes is first criteria, then node address.
Loser enters page scan and sends FHS and vodes to winner.

Poll and ack, each take 2 time slots -> send and idle.

Probability of collision -> check all possible combinations.
